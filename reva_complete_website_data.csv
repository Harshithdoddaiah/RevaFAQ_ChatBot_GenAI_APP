1,Chancellor Message | REVA University,"Founder and ChancellorREVA University In 2004, REVA Group of Institutions was established with the founding philosophy ‘Knowledge is Power’, and since then, we have been committed towards building a community of perpetual learners who can achieve what they aspire. From a small group of 150 students, REVA has grown into a massive community with more than 15,000 students studying at the University every year. As we nurture this community, we have realized learning should be continuous, and cross all borders. Hence, REVA University adopted the mission to make learning unlimited. Our driving principle ‘Learning Unlimited’ is empowered with the adoption of technology. As we have seen in the recent past, technology in education is not just an enabler, but a necessary medium, and the crisis in the Education sector during the pandemic helped us all understand the importance of virtual learning. Going forward, digital-first is an approach every University must adopt, and I am happy to share that much before in 2016 REVA University laid a roadmap to be a technology-driven university. Our early preparedness helped us in transition from offline to online learning. Now, Blended Learning is the way forward and is the biggest enabler of seamless learning. Our core vision remains to change the way students learn from traditional learning methodologies and we are happy to adapt and adopt technological changes. The ecosystem at REVA University is not only tech-centered but is developed in such a way that it contributes to the overall development of a student. Our exclusive executive programme RACE (REVA Academy for Corporate Excellence) has been ranked 2nd in India for MBA in Business Analytics, REVA NEST- the Start-Up Incubator, and many other academic initiatives are designed to make our students corporate-ready. In a step ahead, the UIIC (University-Industry Interaction Centre) programme allows students to interact, engage and learn from industry leaders. The UIIC is an exclusive programme of the University and a key facilitator in bridging the gap between the industry and the academia. In near future, we aim to make all the disciplines at par with our exclusive programmes, and REVA aspires to be a coveted multi-disciplinary institution in the global education sector. True leaders and game-changers are made when a University takes it on its shoulders to mould personalities and gives life to the ideas of its students. With the dedicated efforts of our eminent faculty members, I am certain REVA University students will be guided and mentored in such a way that they will be the leaders and game-changers of tomorrow.

5,REVA Esports | REVA University,"The vision encapsulated in the establishment of the REVARENA club is to encourage and discover the world of competitive gaming and its interplay with sports. The club will act as the bustling hub of gaming, networking with professionals and collaborating with developers to cherish the mutually shared passion for technology and esports. The club would additionally focus on developing and training young talent with the leading professionals in the industry. Esports, or competitive video gaming, has grown rapidly in popularity over the past few years, and many colleges and universities have started to recognize the benefits of having an esports club on campus. Such a club can provide opportunities for students to compete against other colleges, develop skills in teamwork, communication, and strategic thinking, and build a community around a shared interest. One of the main benefits of having an esports club on campus is that it can provide a sense of community and belonging for students who may not otherwise have a place to connect with others who share their interests. It can also help promote diversity and inclusion by providing a space where students of all backgrounds and skill levels can come together and learn from each other. Additionally, esports can help students develop valuable skills that are highly sought after by employers, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. As esports continue to grow in popularity and become more mainstream, having experience in the field can be a valuable asset for students who are interested in pursuing careers in related fields such as game development, marketing, or event management. Overall, an esports club can be a valuable addition to any college or university, providing opportunities for students to compete, build community, and develop valuable skills. A formal Core Committee team has been formed by the students, where over 15 students with specific roles & responsibilities have been established. These roles range from league operators, tournament managers, discord moderators, tournament admins, mobile admins, etc. Committee members team will be reporting to the Director of Physical Education and Sports with day-to-day updates and will be the custodians of managing the club. The club has also identified Student Ambassadors who will represent the University’s interest in the gaming industry. They will closely work with organizations who can support the University in various activities and in bridging the two parties. A university ambassador is a student representative who works on behalf of the university to promote and enhance the institution's image and reputation. Ambassadors are typically chosen based on their academic performance, leadership skills, and involvement in campus activities. University ambassadors can develop skills in communication, leadership, and event planning that can be valuable in their future careers. Currently we have Student Ambassadors for the following esports organizations. REVARENA was a major initiative taken by the School of Legal Studies and Department of Physical Education and Sports.

8,"UNIVERSITY SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES (USR)
 | REVA University","Under the aegis of Rukmini Educational Charitable Trust (RECT), REVA University has an array of University Social Responsibilities taken up year after year with various schools. The Trust is driven by the larger goal of nurturing students who are in pursuit of quality education. Some of the USR activities include Abhivriddhi, Jagruti, REVA Vanamahotsava and Education on Wheels. These activities allow students to improve their understanding of sustainable development goals and sensitise them to community needs and play an important role in understanding the importance of giving back to society. The second phase of Jagruti –towards Global Warmingas a part of the University’s Social responsibility saw the culmination of it’s year long activities on the 19th of June, 2020. The programme was held at the REVA Rangasthala with strict observance of social distancing. On the day the souvenir which chronicled the various activities conducted under the second phase of the campaign was released by the Chancellor, Dr. P. Shyama Raju. The brain child of Dr. P. Shyama Raju, Honourable Chancellor, REVA University, Jagruti is a cause that is close to everyone’s heart at REVA. 2018 saw the conception of RELA- REVA Electoral Literacy Association, an organized effort to spread a sense of civic responsibility towards voting among citizens and thereby inducing their democratic sensibility. Thus was born Jagruti, its first programme. The main focus currently is the constituency of Byatarayanapura in Bengaluru. An awakening! A rise to action, a quiet revolution that could only be fostered amidst a growing intellectual community like REVA. In spite of an energetic cosmopolitan population, Bengaluru has been moving backward in terms of participation in the democratic machinery of the country. The overall aggregate voting enrollment and participation from urban India has been rather poor, as observed through the country. This disappointment strongly points towards the eminent failure and loss of faith amongst this populace in the ideals of democracy, so arduously built by the freedom struggle and the architects of our constitution. A large democracy naturally translates to a large voting population due to its sheer size. However, our country here needs a step up, not just in active involvement but also in being equipped with the right knowledge. This precipitation needs a boost. REVA Electoral Literacy Association (RELA) is a convinced endeavor by the University, faculty and students, to conscientiously evoke in citizens the awareness, knowledge of and need for ideally functioning democratic processes. The essence and vision of RELA is aligned with empowerment of the citizens for better participation in the electoral democracy in voluntarily registering and ethically voting in every election. REVA has been conducting interactive activities in the University campus to impart electoral education to students. The students have actively immersed themselves in a consolidated foregrounding required for this enterprising and enriching task. In order to inform and expose students to Indian General Elections, RELA had organized and ensured their participation in debates, essay writing competitions, Nirvachitra- a film show, celebration of National Voter’s Day, Democracy Wall and elucidation of the electoral history of the Country. The campaign was inaugurated on 16th November 2018. Sri Sanjiv Kumar, IAS, Chief Electoral Officer, Karnataka was the Chief Guest of this event. Sri Sreenivasachary, IAS (Retd.,), State Election Commission was the Guest of Honour of this event and Dr. P. Shyama Raju, Hon’ble Chancellor, REVA University presided over the event. This event witnessed the oath taking ritual for all at REVA to uphold independent India’s democratic values. The Guests and other dignitaries shared their thoughts on the growing need for democratic values to come into play for the betterment of our society. Student volunteers also exhibited a play which proclaimed the importance of voting. As part of this initiative, REVA has adopted 10 government schools located around Bengaluru North (Yelahanka and Devanahalli constituencies) in the fringes of the city. The pilot of ‘Abhivriddhi’ was launched in August 2020 and the core committee members of Abhivriddhi have conducted several in-depth surveys over the last five months to ascertain the requirements, challenges, and other details of the adopted schools. ‘Abhivriddhi’ is launched with a mission to aid quality education at government schools and aims to overhaul the learning experience at these schools. Currently, around 1000 students are learning in these schools, but due to the closure of schools as a Covid-19 protocol, have remained home during the pandemic. To transform this chain of government schools as ‘Model Schools’ REVA University has categorized its developmental activities into three categories – Akshara, Ashraya, and Adarsha - 3A MANTRA– aimed to upgrade the quality of education, civil infrastructure, and the overall education quality and disciple of a student. The CSR initiative will be taken up under different phases, spanned over the next few years. In August 2021, REVA University launched ‘REVA Vanamahotsava’, a novel initiative of REVA University to plant 15,000 saplings in the state. Under this Initiative, the institution launched the ‘One Student, One Tree’ campaign, which aims to build a clean and green environment with the active involvement of students. The initiative, with support from students and faculty, is REVA’s commitment to environmental conservation and the reduction of global warming. Additionally, the AICTE recommends that every institute conduct should plantation drive. As part of REVA University's ""One Student, One Tree"" programme, Vanamahotsava aims to organise a tree-planting drive in schools and villages. Its goal is to have each REVA University student plant a sapling. For at least the first two years following planting, students should take care of these plants. The REVA Vanamahotsava, which was started with a goal of planting 15,000 saplings in 2021–2022 and one seedling for every new student admitted to REVA University starting in AY 2022–2023, has advanced the social effort by planting more than 16000 saplings to date. Education on Wheels (EOW) is an integrated approach to improving the quality of education for underprivileged children. It seeks to ensure pre-primary and primary education for all children up to the age of 14 leading to their overall development. Education on Wheels, a student outreach initiative was launched to provide immersive learning experiences to students of community schools in rural areas. The University takes modern education to the doorsteps of the students through a mobile lab with a 15-seater facility, equipped with learning infrastructure like a projector, computers, wi-fi connection, and SMART TV, among other facilities. The lab also introduces students to basic and advanced learning in emerging domains like block coding, designing, and other areas. It envisions providing comprehensive skills to students through the lab and fostering the holistic development of students. REVA University believes quality education is the right of every child, and to empower them with modern education, ‘Education on Wheels’ has been launched. Through this initiative, students will gain free access to digital learning and will be trained in certification programmes. 21/Apr 2024 Jatha and Flag hoisting 15/Feb 2024 Constitution Awareness 16/Nov 2023 EDUCATION ON WHEELS – AN OUTREACH PROGRAM 08/Sep 2023 Education on Wheels - Government Higher Primary School, Kithiganur 8th September 01/Sep 2023 Education on Wheels - Government Higher Primary School, Kithiganur 1st September 19/Aug 2023 Education on Wheels - Government Primary School, Bhattarahalli 18/Aug 2023 Education on Wheels - Government Higher Primary School Kithiganur 14/Aug 2023 Education on Wheels (EOW) 12/Aug 2023 Education on wheel visit to Govt Primary School, Bhattarahalli Bangalore 12/July 2023 Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany experienced"" Education on Wheels"" 30/March 2023 Education on Wheels - School of Computer Science and Applications 10/Dec 2022 Education on Wheels at Jalige, Devanahalli 10/Dec 2022 Education on Wheels + Origami workshop at Jalige, Devanahalli 05/Dec 2022 Education on Wheels (EOW)-Government Higher Primary School, Marenahalli REVA Krushi Tech Project, an embodied vision of Chancellor Dr. P. Shyama Raju, is portrayed as the promotion of education and ecological sustenance. The project, which encourages green life and sustainable agriculture and fosters a culture of self-reliance in food security, aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). RKTP was inaugurated at REVA University as part of Gandhi Jayanti celebrations. The Chancellor Dr. P. Shyama Raju officially launched the Grow Bag planting and vertical modular agritecture on the campus. Through RKTP, REVA University promotes hands-on experiential learning, research in sustainable agriculture, and community engagement in food security measures. This University project aims to bridge the knowledge gaps serve as an educative tool and establish an interdisciplinary initiative that fosters innovative learning experiences in agriculture advances and connects with the local community. REVA University recognizes the importance of growing fresh, healthy produce involving the students’ community. To cater to this need and contribute to the larger goal of sustainability, REVA University has organised a series of activities under the project. Chancellor Dr. P. Shyama Raju officially launched the Grow Bag planting and vertical modular agritecture on the campus. Grow Bag Cultivation On the launch day, around 300 grow bags were planted as part of REVA University’s commitment towards building a greener and sustainable world. Besides inspiring everyone to grow their fresh vegetables in grow bags, it also helps to learn about sustainable agriculture, share knowledge and enjoy the benefits of home-grown produce. The grow bag vegetable cultivation approach is designed to provide an ideal environment for plant growth, and it offers several benefits like space efficiency, water conservation, and portability. The grow bags of about 300 seedlings of potatoes, tomato, capsicum, chillies, and brinjal are planted by the students and will be individually allotted for their peer learning and nurturing. Vertical gardening or Vertical Agritecture Vertical gardening or Vertical Agritecture takes advantage of vertical spaces, transforming walls, fences, and even indoor areas into lush green gardens. The vertical modular agritecture is a wall-mounted structure in a soil-less medium and uses recycled resources. It is a blend of orientation (vertical) and agriculture with elements of architecture. This method offers several advantages like maximized space utilization, enhanced aesthetics, improved air quality, and biodiversity. It is a pilot model, with an eco-friendly vertical structure with an exotic vegetable demonstration unit. As part of the expansion, the team plans to organise a series of other activities in the future. Among them, Aeroponics, a soil-less plant-growing method is of top priority. The Aeroponics method involves suspending plants in an air or mist environment and offers various advantages like efficient water usage, accelerated plant growth and reduced pesticide use. Besides it promotes faster growth and efficient nutrient absorption. REVA University is also planning to promote Hydroponics, another soil-less farming technique which is an efficient, controlled environment for plant growth. It promotes sustainable agriculture in both urban and rural settings, contributing to food security and reduced environmental impact. It also helps to save water and allows year-round cultivation. REVA also plans to install roof gardens and photo voltaic gardens which are eco-friendly and energy-efficient methods of cultivation with the active participation of students. REVA University is one of the few multidisciplinary Universities that uphold the culture and heritage through its various social outreach initiatives. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and NEP policy, the Department of Sports & Physical Education at REVA University has come up with a unique initiative called Khel Khoj, which is an attempt to bring to modern society the importance of traditional games and bring them back as a component of the Indian Knowledge System. With time, we have not only lost the zeal for indigenous games but also there are fewer playing spaces for children and students. In this modern era, it is always a challenge to find new ways to play traditional games in limited spaces. As pioneers in higher education and a Social Impact University, REVA, in alignment with UN SDGs, NEP 2020 and G20 India has initiated Khel Khoj to promote and revitalise indigenous sports. By doing this, REVA aligns with the Ministry of Education, Government of India and its mission to bring back traditional games from different Indian states. The name Khel Khoj means ‘Search for Games’. India has a rich culture and tradition and has always included sports and games with some ancient games dating back thousands of years. NEP 2020 talks in detail about how Universities must take the lead to bring innovative changes in our curriculum, by incorporating its suggestions and making a creative change in the education policy. This is where REVA University opened its door as pioneers in the country to conduct various events to uphold the culture and tradition. Khel Khoj is one of these many initiatives started by REVA. Khel Khoj event will kickstart at the REVA campus on February 11, 2023. The event will be held in Saugandhika, REVA University Sports ground and the open pathways inside the campus. As a part of this, REVA has identified more than 35 indigenous games that have their roots in various Indian states. In its initial phase of Khel Khoj, REVA focuses on field sports, martial arts, and indoor / board games, with intentions to expand on this with additional native games from different parts of the country. Each School will take up two indigenous sports and showcase them by exhibiting under various categories like the history of the sport, the values each game inculcate and showcasing the sport with various costumes, equipment and pictures. Additionally, there will be an activity where students and others can participate in games or experience a portion of the game Depending on the sports or games, there will also be team-building activities, research on the history of the games, coordination with associations of each sport, procurement of materials and eventually the execution of the games.

Pañcavaktraṁ is a production by the School of Performing Arts & Indic Studies of REVA University that highlights the five faces of Śiva – Sadāśiva and elaborates on them through significant stories from Indian mythology. As a part of the first phase of our campaign, we will be performing in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, New Delhi, Chennai, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, and Varanasi.

The local art and artistes will be felicitated in each city. There will be special seating arrangements for the press and media. The SOPAIS will have a special stall in each venue that features information about various courses and other facilities available in the school. REVA is one of the few Multidisciplinary Universities that uphold the Indian culture and heritage through the SOPAIS. The Performing Arts, comprising music, dance, and theatre, are in demand as career choices, like never before. SOPAIS offers unique, challenging Performing Arts and Indic Studies programmes that prepare artistes for the future. These courses aim to bring a holistic view to the performing arts education system in India. NEP 2020 talks in detail about how art institutions must take the lead to bring innovative changes in our curriculum, by incorporating its suggestions and making a creative change in the education policy. This is where SOPAIS at REVA University opened its door as pioneers in the country to conduct various courses and events to uphold the culture and tradition. In alignment with the SDG goals and NEP policy, SOPAIS has taken up the initiative of bringing up this unique production called Pañcavaktraṁ which is a commitment towards society. It creates an awareness about the art and helps revive our age-old tradition and culture. Pancha means five and Vaktra means faces. The five faces are Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa, and Eśāna and they are embodied through the five elements of nature or the Pañcabhūta - Bhūmi, Jala, Agni, Vāyu, and Akāśa. This production is of tremendous significance in the contemporary context. Our ancient treatises and texts chronicle a progressive and “woke” India that is gender-sensitive. The fact that the Lord Siva as Ardhanārīśvara encompasses the male and the female as two halves of the ultimate whole, the total of which is an all-embracing concept of gender and sexuality that existed long before these genders were separated brutally. The piece showcases the confluence of the five elements of Nature that are an integral part of the Indian spiritual identity. Our Vedic gods themselves were incarnations of different aspects of nature. The production showcases how the five elements superimpose each other with ease in their existence and movement creating harmony and balance in nature. Humans, unaware of the importance of ancient thought have time and again interfered with this balance. This production bridges the gap between the audience who live amidst the smog of global warming, extensive urbanization, and natural resource depletion, and the age-old tradition that has enlightening tales of sustainable development, harmonious living, and the importance of nature. Under NEP, arts in education is a must and also promotes Indian languages, arts, and culture. REVA University is an interdisciplinary university that offers courses in Performing Arts. To empower teachers and overcome the challenges post-pandemic, the School of Performing Arts and Indic Studies has curated a unique certification course named ABHIVYAKTI for K 12 teachers. The objective of ABHIVYAKTI is to enhance the non-verbal communication of teachers in the post-pandemic era through facial expressions, gestures, and Natya techniques of Indian knowledge systems. The program includes arts, storytelling, the power of expression, dance and expressions, artificial intelligence in understanding the emotions of today’s students, and the importance of verbal communication in teaching-learning in the post-pandemic era. The certificate program will be delivered by an expert faculty team of the REVA School of Performing Arts along with an online session by an expert from an International University. The program will be organised for all CBSE/ICSE/State Board government and private schools as part of the Outreach program and Teacher Empowerment Strategy of REVA University. Day 1of Abhivyakti featured a lecture demonstration by Prof Manvita on the topic Bhāva which spoke of effective communication through facial expressions. We had teachers from various schools come for the event and engage wholeheartedly in the entire event as Prof. Manvita took them through a series of exercises and games on effective methods of communicating and from someone with such a body of experience in the field of education backed by her strong background in psychology and the performing arts, the advice shared was invaluable. Day 2of Abhivyakti featured a talk by noted dancer/academician, Dr. Viji Rao on the module of Angika. She highlighted the use of Angas (major limbs) and Pratyangas (ancillary limbs) in teaching. Her lesson for relevant and pertinent for all teachers but also included some key aspects of dance that can be utilised in teaching methods that help faculty maintain agility and energy while standing on their feet and delivering lectures. With her wealth of experience she was able to equip the attendees with useful tools for their work. Day 3of Abhivyakti was about Dhwani, voice modulation and projection with two interesting sessions. The first session was conducted by Prof. Kavana, Carnatic Music specialist who spoke about the different variations in voice that can be applied by teachers. She was able to address many questions by the participants on the importance of modulation in conveying the true intent of the lesson to the students. Prof. Akshar, a versatile theatrician, conducted an interactive session on the importance of Voice projection as a teacher in order to be able to have command over and the attention of the class. It was a lively and intriguing session for all participants. Day 4of Abhivyakti was conducted by Prof. Deepa Pillai and by Prof Anusha. The lecture was about storytelling. The speakers spoke about the tool of storytelling being very powerful and its impact on children. Storytelling is an essential part of teaching as the elements of Katha, when incorporated into teaching can transform dry subject matter to impactful and intriguing lessons. Day 5of Abhivyakti featured a talk by Mr. Hareesh, founder of Luminous, an illuminator of Science and Humanity, Preventia house, Bengaluru. His module was based on Varnana, or narrative elements which are particularly significant for teachers. He captivated the minds of all attendees with important pointers on narration that can be used in day-to-day teaching. Prof. Subhobroto from a neighbouring K12 school opined that there were a lot of important take-aways for him as a teacher in a school dealing with multiple age groups and he also spoke about how it would impact his teaching methodology going forward. Indian Knowledge System is extremely rich in providing various skill sets that one can learn and put into practice these skill to overcome the challenges and become good communicators. The School of performing Arts and Indic Studies is facilitating the process of adapting the skill sets that are clearly propounded in ancient Indian knowledge systems related to performing arts. The 5-day intensive training programme for teachers of K12 schools for non-verbal communication culminated on the 30th of September with a ceremony presided over by Honourable Chancellor, Dr P Shyamaraju. Teachers from different schools shared their experiences and feedback over the workshop and were presented with certificates by Honourable Chancellor sir and Director, School of Performing Arts & Indic Studies, Dr Vidya Kumari S who spearheaded this event. As socially responsible citizens and an institution committed to civic responsibility, we at REVA University, have started a movement‘Pragna’to raise awareness on road safety and road discipline. The neighbourhood is home to a number of schools and colleges apart from our University and hospitals. It is a common occurrence during rush hours for students to struggle to cross the street and arrive at school/ college on time. Women in particular are having trouble making it to their destination in a timely manner when they are walking on the footpath. Additionally, there are a number of hospitals in the area, making it challenging for emergency patients to get there on time owing to road indiscipline. As the stakeholders of REVA University, it is our responsibility to ensure that the safety on roads is kept up to par. It is in this juncture REVA has initiated ‘Pragna’ campaign in association with the traffic police, NSS, NCC, and the neighbouring educational institutions. REVA will run this campaign from October 2022 to November 2022. During this time, we will also create civic awareness at strategic points through the use of placards with safety messages, personal connect with larger institutions, appeal for cooperation, and ensure due publicity is given to generate awareness. REVA University embraces gender equality as a way of our life. Like Maya Angelou, we believe that it is our priority “to teach young people early on that in diversity, there is beauty, and there is strength” and we practice this whole-heartedly. Aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal V – Gender Equality - the School of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, REVA University, is proud to host Karnataka Rajyotsava awardee Dr. Akkai Padmashali, well-known transgender activist, at REVA University on Thursday, 10th November 2022.

The term ‘Nyaya’ refers to Justice and ‘Darshana’ means vision. The School of Legal Studies, one of the prestigious law schools in the country at REVA University has come forward to bring in a social awareness campaign, especially among women, who are comparatively fewer in number in the domain of law. Nyaya Darshana is a series of events that contributes to the social development and betterment of society in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals IV, V, and XI. “Nyaya Darshana” is an initiative of the School of Legal Studies to imbibe moral and ethical values along with the study of law, and to ensure a sense of social responsibility in the students- aligning the goals of providing quality education and holistic development to the students with the Sustainable Development Goals. In Greece, the meaning of the word justice is “to each his due”. It means that every person gets what they deserve with moral, ethical, and legal considerations. In Roman society, the law was considered to be fair and just. The Representation of Lady Justice comes from a Roman society where she is the Goddess of Justice. In India, the representation of the Indian symbol of Justice is represented with a balance scale to show evidence must be weighed neutrally, while the representation of the blindfold shows impartiality to those in front of justice and the sword represents swiftness and finality of justice. Nyaya Darshana is aligned with SDG goals IV, V, and VII which signifies bringing awareness of justice to the rural and urban sectors, encouraging more women to participate in Nyaya Darshana, and collaborating and partnership with judges, political leaders, and advocates through legal aid centre of the School of Legal Studies respectively. The main objectives of Nyaya Darshana are: As part of the Nyaya Darshana, Probono clubs, lecture series, and panel meets are organised. This includes Pro Bono legal general services, lecture by learned judges and eminent advocates as well as legal aid to villages. 10/Feb 2023 Vehicle Emission Testing Camp @ REVA 17/Oct 2022 Pro Bono Club Outreach Program @ Beechagondahalli 08/Nov 2022 Nyaya Darshana-""Women in Politics - Need of the hour"" 08/Nov 2022 Nyaya Darshana – Tejasvi Surya @ REVA Rukmini Knowledge Park, Kattigenahalli, Yelahanka, Bangalore, Karnataka, India, 560 064 © RECT All Rights ReservedWebsite Design and Developmentby Sterco Digitex © RECT All Rights ReservedWebsite Design and Developmentby Sterco Digitex Notices Call Chat Admissions Grand Alumni Meet: 2026 – Nepal Advances in Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing Technologies – Build by Print (AASMT-2026) New Digital Twin for Destination: TerraDT Health and Cancer Screening Camp Report REVA Humanoid - Mascot Naming & Design Competition – Student Submission Guidelines REVA University x Stellantis Present ""STELLATHON 2025"" International Conference on Language, Literature and Linguistics - ICLLL 2025 REVA University 13th Annual Athletic Meet -2025 (Men &Women) Alumni Connect 2025 REVA University Inter School Badminton Tournament (Men/Women) – 2025"

17,Vice Chancellor Of REVA University | Leadership And Vision,"Vice ChancellorREVA University You are well aware that disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), 3D Printing, Robotics, High-Speed Travel, Block Chain Technologies, Medical Innovations, Autonomous Vehicles, Advanced Virtual Reality, and Renewable Energy have disrupted traditional industries and businesses. This could happen because of the digital revolution. During Covid-19, the evolution of digital technologies in higher education and the recent NEP have started disrupting the traditional university system of education. The Governments and institutions are trying to establish online digital universities which will not have set boundaries at all. In the immediate future, a student will have a choice to choose his/her course of study from any university located in any part of the world and learn from a teacher of his /her liking. Many corporate houses are pondering on establishing their own digital universities. There lies the challenge for a traditional university like REVA. A university system will be focussing mainly on teaching and learning; research and innovation and professional services. As a University, we would like to bring revolutionary changes in these major activities to remain in the competition. Our immediate goal is to achieve the status of “Institution of Eminence” and in the near future, we would like to be a World Class University. We strive to make our students, great thinkers and meet not only their aspirations and even their parents. We would keep India's scientific, technological, economic and social aspects in mind while developing our curriculum. In all, REVA University will focus on developing the emotional, intellectual, social, economic, environmental, spiritual and physical well-being of every student. I understand that to make these happen, the resources required are enormous, but the committed management and visionary leadership will help overcome these challenges. We strive to make REVA -A University of the Future!

36,Counselling Centre | REVA University,"Introduction Manodhaara-REVA Centre for Well-being is a student support service offered by REVA University in Bengaluru. Our mission is to help students to transform themselves to achieve their best physical and mental health through various services that cater to their needs. At Manodhaara, we understand that students face a variety of challenges that can impact their overall health and well-being, not just their academic and social growth. That's why we take a holistic approach to wellness, focusing on the mind, body, and spirit. Our goal is to help students achieve balance and harmony in their lives so that they can thrive academically and personally. Currently housed in G-03, Vivekananda Block, the centre is nestled among the engineering and non-engineering schools, easily accessible to the students, but secluded enough to offer them privacy. We are committed to provide a safe and supportive environment, where students feel safe and comfortable seeking help. At Manodhaara, we believe that well-being is not only about physical health, but also about emotional and psychological health. That's why we offer counselling services to help students cope with stress, anxiety, and other challenges that can impact their mental well-being. We also understand that seeking help can be challenging, so the services come to you with an assurance that all information shared would be confidential and only by consent. Our goal is to help students develop healthy coping skills, improve relationships and grow to their fullest potential. Student Services include individual counselling and therapy for individuals, small groups, parents and teachers; talks and workshops are also conducted for large groups by the in-house counsellors. Preliminary assessment for disorders like anxiety, depression, Mood disorders, etc. are done and referred further to the psychiatrist where needed. The University’s in-house Yoga and Zumba expert works closely with the counselling team using Yoga, Pranayama, Meditation and dance as supportive therapeutic measures. We also have experts from other organizations offering medical and psychiatric services on a referral basis. Manodhaara has partnered with Mind and Brain Hospital, Bangalore, and through this collaboration, we will be offering training, internships and job opportunities for students of psychology, under the guidance of expert neuropsychiatrists, psychologists and special educators. We are in the process of collaborating with other Healthcare organizations like NIMHANS and I-AIM / Transdisciplinary University. Manodhaara’s focus for the well-being of the students is on enabling them to understand and take charge of their own health. So our approach is holistic as well as preventive. Psycho-education through workshops and talks are conducted throughout the year. Experts from the field of medicine, psychiatry, rehabilitation, nutrition etc., are regularly invited to interact with the students. The Centre is looking to expand its activities into research, training and outreach programmes not just for the REVA family but to the community at large, and in particular for the benefit of the students of the Government schools that have been adopted by REVA University. Our vision is to create a one-of-its-kind wellness centre that is a one-stop solution to all well-being concerns. Surprisingly, most youngsters go through more than one such challenge which results in an unpredictable lifestyle that may have a negative impact on their academic performance as well as behavioural pattern. They are reluctant to discuss their problems with their own parents, teachers/lecturers, friends and relatives as they get worried about the consequences. The counsellor helps you to address your problems in a positive way by helping you to clarify the issues, explore options, develop strategies and increase self-awareness.

40,Pro Chancellors Message | REVA University,"Pro ChancellorREVA University Education today is undergoing a transformative shift as we embrace the global movement toward a future defined by digital advancements and disruptive technologies. In this era of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, and Robotics, the time has come to reimagine and reform education both nationally and globally. At REVA, we are committed to leading this transformation with a focus on innovation and adaptability. The future of education is undoubtedly digital. I firmly believe that as we transition to Industry 4.0, we must also adopt Education 4.0—an approach that integrates technology to make learning more dynamic, accessible, and relevant. At REVA University, our dedicated faculty and forward-thinking stakeholders are poised to equip students with the tools and opportunities to thrive in an ever-changing technological landscape. Technology, I believe, will not only redefine learning but also bring students from across the globe closer, fostering collaboration and shared knowledge. Beyond technology, we are equally dedicated to making REVA a Social Impact University. Our phased commitment to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), empowering women in education, and preserving our rich cultural heritage reflects our broader vision. However, achieving these goals requires a collective reset of our university ecosystem—one that places quality education and societal progress at its core. Together, let us shape a future where innovation, inclusivity, and excellence define education. At REVA University, the possibilities are limitless, and the journey to becoming a world-class institution has already begun.

The candidates at times come face to face with certain social issues or problems which tend to bring inferiority complex in them. Additionally, mentors provide suggestions and address all academic, personal, career, and psychological issues. Parent-teacher meetings will be organised once a semester to obtain feedback on facilities, the teaching-learning process, and mentoring. All the parents will be informed about their wards’ progress and avenues existing in the university to the students. A 10 bedded hospital on the campus provides medical facilities prescribed by a resident doctor and first aid for minor injuries. Duty nurses are available 24 X7 for assistance. They take good care of students with health-related issues. Also, the University has signed MoU with corporate hospitals and during emergencies, the students will be treated there. Further, the office of the Dean Students Welfare provides support to students to overcome challenges related to personal issues and to become successful in their education and professional life. REVA has very good hostels caters to the needs of the students. All the rooms are widely spaced, and the surrounding environment is conducive to live and study.

56,Educate To Enterprise:REVA University’s Bold Step Towards The Future,"REVA University, one of Bangalore’s leading institutions of higher education, is redefining the way students learn, think, and create impact. In an era shaped by Artificial Intelligence, sustainability, and innovation, REVA has launched a bold new strategic direction — “Educate to Enterprise” — a philosophy that empowers every learner to think beyond degrees and develop an enterprising mindset. At its core, Educate to Enterprise is not about ensuring every student becomes an entrepreneur — it’s about helping every student think like one. The idea represents REVA University’s belief that true education must go beyond academics. It should nurture creativity, innovation, problem-solving, and leadership — qualities that help students contribute meaningfully to society. Enterprise, in this vision, means initiative. It means resilience. It means the ability to identify opportunities, solve real-world challenges, and create sustainable impact — whether one chooses to work in a company, build a startup, design a city, or teach the next generation. REVA University has always aligned its mission with national aspirations and global expectations, contributing to the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. With Educate to Enterprise, REVA is taking that mission further — preparing students not only to secure jobs, but to create opportunities for others. When students graduate as engineers, architects, lawyers, artists, or psychologists, they carry more than a degree; they carry the mindset of changemakers. They are trained to view challenges through the lens of innovation and enterprise — understanding that every idea can lead to value creation. The world is evolving rapidly, driven by technology and social transformation. Traditional education systems often focus on rote learning and degree-based success, but it demands something more — entrepreneurial thinking. By developing this mindset,REVA Universityequips its students to navigate uncertainty with confidence and creativity. They learn to apply classroom knowledge to solve real-world problems, build sustainable solutions, and make meaningful contributions to communities. Under the leadership of Chancellor Dr. P. Shyama Raju, REVA University emphasises delivering a sustainable education that prepares graduates both emotionally and cognitively, helping them develop a mindset that lasts a lifetime. The Educate to Enterprise philosophy integrates seamlessly with REVA’s culture of experiential learning, industry collaboration, and research excellence. Through hands-on projects, innovation hubs, startup support, and interdisciplinary learning, REVA nurtures students who are not just job seekers, but job creators and global problem-solvers. REVA University believes that India does not lack talent — it only needs the right mindset. Educating to Enterprise is the University’s commitment to building that mindset across disciplines. As REVA moves forward with this bold vision, it invites students, faculty, and partners to embrace this philosophy — to think big, act responsibly, and contribute to the well-being of all. It is REVA’s unique vision of transforming education into enterprise—encouraging students to apply learning creatively to solve real-world problems and generate social and economic impact. Through initiatives like REVA NEST, the Technology Business Incubator inside the campus, industry tie-ups, and project-based learning, REVA gives students the tools, mentorship, and ecosystem needed to innovate and launch ventures. All programmes—across engineering, design, management, law, science, and Liberal studies, Performing Arts—integrate enterprise-focused learning outcomes that build creativity, critical thinking, and innovation.

It consists of 20 reserved oxygen cylinders and six oxygen concentrators for the continuous production/supply of oxygen to the patients. RCCC is a dedicated centre for the treatment of COVID. RCCC treats all patients with mild and moderate symptoms under surveillance. These are the primary level health care centres that provide care to all kinds of patients in the COVID hospitals  to avoid crowding directly in the COVID hospitals and wasting resources. Also, RCCC has a properly structured patient management system as per the MoHFW and KMEP guidelines as mentioned below. Consultation with the public-spirited Medical Officer/Physicians Health Care Worker: Professional health care provider, well-trained medical officer, physician, nurse, radio technologist, medical lab technologist, and physiotherapist. RHC has a designated driver and staff, particularly for a dedicated ambulance equipped with 47 litres oxygen cylinder with tubing (Oxy flow meter) along with a backup stock of 47 litres (minimum of 20 Nos) at REVA Health Centre. Separation of individuals who are not yet ill but have been exposed to COVID-19 and therefore have a potential to become ill. RCCC quarantine facility includes 100 dispensary beds with separate room quarantine for contacts of suspect/ confirmed cases. The contacts will be monitored and advised quarantine will undergo risk profiling. Interferential Therapy (IFT) is the most common type of electrical muscle stimulation used to treat chronic pain resulting from surgery, injury, or trauma. The end goal of using Interferential current Therapy (ICT) as part of a physical therapy or rehab program is to relieve pain and help patients heal faster. Brio combination therapy including two-channel Electropathy and single channel Ultrasound is for the most effective treatment of pain and tissue repair in less time. Biomedical Waste, (BMW) or bio-wastes are potentially hazardous waste materials, consisting of solids, liquids, sharps, and laboratory waste. It comes from biological sources or is used in the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases. One of the major sources of biomedical waste are hospitals and nursing homes. The hospital waste has to be disposed of carefully after segregation. We at REVA Health Centre have made MoU with Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Disposal Facility (CBMWTDF) for the disposal of waste after segregation to reduce nosocomial infection thus promoting health in the clinical sector. Clean and ventilated rooms with toilet facilities, proper electricity, water, and internet connectivity, healthy & hygienic food, and drinking water facility. It also ensures the security and safety of individuals. RCCC has structured a clear pandemic plan for risk assessment and is working to ensure that our teams have the right tools and information to manage the COVID-19 outbreak and reduce transmission risk and mitigate any suspected or confirmed cases, whether at work or at home. RCCC SOPs enable safe, preventive, and reactive management of healthcare setup and tasks, where suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified. Our REVA HEALTH CENTRE working in the healthcare sector provides the on-ground experience of working in environments with potential or actual infectious diseases and the ability to quickly respond and develop systems of work around the COVID 19 outbreak, specifically RCCC at REVA HEALTH CENTRE has separate surveillance and supervisory teams to provide transportation for isolated COVID-infected patients. Our health centre has ambulance facilities with restricted access to the general public. The field staff for the surveillance activities and for providing perimeter control will be accommodated within the containment zone. RCCC will stick to SOPs in disposing of bio-medical waste (discarded PPEs, etc.), utilizing the bio-medical waste management services at the designated hospital. To avoid cluster containment, the RCCC protocol is structured with proper social distancing measures that would be a key intervention to rapidly curtail the community transmission of COVID-19 by limiting interaction between infected persons and susceptible hosts.

112,Teaching Methodology | REVA University,"Most of the professors believe that they are making progress toward a learning-centre model, as the instructors believe that implementation of active methodologies implies new functions in their teaching practice. In thismethod, teachers convey knowledge to their students primarily through lectures without considering student preferences or opportunities for hands-on or other types of learning. Students are given the study material in advance and during classes, students will interact with the instructor to clarify their doubts about the material. In this method, students perform hands-on physical activities rather than listening to lectures or watching demonstrations. During practical, particularly in engineering and sciences, students work for lab practice. In this method, teachers offer support and guidance as students work on projects that depend on them taking on a more active and participatory role in their own learning. This also provides project-based learning to the students. Every faculty will provide some topics for self-learning during the subject delivery in the classrooms to have a better understanding of concepts. Also, teachers offer some traditional instructions as well as online material, while continually reviewing the students’ progress and meeting them to make any needed changes to their learning plans.

121,Employee Engagement | REVA University,"REVA University believes that employees are the foundation of any University. Over the years, the concept of employee engagement has grown in importance as it affects employees’ productivity and the effectiveness of the University. Hence it is important to design better approaches for employee engagement. Effective employee engagement happens when the employees are focused on their tasks and go above and beyond to provide better results that are in alignment with the University’s core values and objectives. Employee engagement has an impact on job quality, productivity, attitude, and innovation. It also makes the University more appealing as an employer. When a University satisfies these criteria, its employees are more engaged, and the University becomes more attractive to job seekers. For precisely this reason, numerous employee engagement strategies are in place at REVA. Our goal is to increase employee commitment to the point where there are fewer absences, conflicts, and increased productivity. Since engagement is an unwritten and unspoken expectation from the employees, it is also considered as a social contract between the employee and the employer.

145,About University | REVA University,"Established in 2012, REVA University is a forerunner in delivering technology-based education. Recognised as one of the Top 50 private universities in India, REVA University, with innovative pedagogy, exemplary infrastructure, and an industry-resilient curriculum that is designed for the future job market, strives to benchmark new milestones in modern education. In less than two decades, the University has grown from a small community of 150 students to a vast institution that is educating and empowering 15,000+ students on campus. REVA University prides itself in contributing to every student's holistic development. UG Programmes PG Programmes Ph.D. Programmes Diploma Programmes Minor and Honours Programmes The University offers programmes in Engineering, Architecture, Science & Technology, Commerce, Management Studies, Law, Liberal Studies and Performing Arts. Courses are offered in Certificate/Diploma and Post Graduate Diploma too. REVA University facilitates research leading to a Doctoral Degree in all disciplines. The programmes offered by REVA University are well-planned and designed based on methodical analysis and research with emphasis on knowledge assimilation, practical applications, hands-on training, global and industrial relevance, and their social significance. REVA University believes in preparing students through the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) and Continuous Assessment and Grading Pattern (CAGP) of education. The CBCS & CAGP pattern of education has been introduced in all programmes to enable students to opt for subjects of their choice in addition to the core subjects of study and to train them with vocational skills. This methodology helps students earn more credits and facilitates students to pursue additional proficiency certificates and diplomas. The faculty is an active part of the academic dialogue. Teachers and instructors with illustrious academic experience are the architects of the meticulously designed curriculum and programme modules offered at REVA University. They come with industrial exposure and experience that often translates through their teaching, thus bridging the gap between industry and academia. REVA University has an updated, ever-evolving collection of books, journals, and digital content in the library with the latest IT infrastructure that ensures students have information at their disposal. REVA logo depicts ‘Srivatsa’ or “the endless knot”. The Srivatsa has rich significance in Indian Symbolism- in the religions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Chief among its varied interpretations is that it represents the interplay of opposite forces in the world and a final merging of the dual, leading to harmony. It binds and connects all the stakeholders- the teacher and the learner at one level; and at another level connects the individual units of the institution to make it a harmonious whole. The ‘endless knot’ signifies the continuous process of learning which has neither a beginning nor an end. In the Tibetan branch of Buddhism the endless knot signifies both wisdom and compassion which are essential in making the teaching-learning process meaningful and productive. Finally, the logo in its digitized version embodies the institution’s blend of tradition and technology – a blend that signifies change and evolution at the individual and collective level and finally the societal level. The lush green campus, state-of-the-art laboratories, custom-designed classrooms to enable seamless learning, and world-class indoor and outdoor sports facilities make REVA University the most preferred university among students and MNCs that visit the campus for placements.
